# HR_Squared-WozU-Agile-Project

This is the Agile Project I developed prior to graduating from Bethel Tech (WozU).  It was initially designed for a team but adapted to a solo project. This application is a Master/Detail list for organizing and managing the Human Resources information of a fictional company named 'HR Squared.'  Here are some of the project details...

  -	The front end was built using React and React-Bootstrap
  -	The back end was built using ASP.NET Core (C#) with a Database First approach utilizing Entity Framework
  -	The database (SQL Server) is comprised of 2 tables in a one-to-many relationship.  The first table contains the Employee data, and       the second table contains the names of the specific Healthcare Plans.  For development, the database was hosted locally.  For           project Demo Day, the database was run in AWS (Amazon RDS.)  

Here are some screenshots of the running application...
